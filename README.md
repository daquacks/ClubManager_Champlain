# Club Manager
## Introduction
Have you ever tried looking for clubs in Champlain, going to their site, only to find outdated information? <br>
Have you ever participated in a club, and missed an event, because of poor communication within the group? <br>
Hell, there's barely even any information about the existing clubs at Champlain on Omnivox.

Well, the Club Manager fixes the current messy state of club-accessibility for those that are seeking for a new group to join, curious about other clubs, or even for executives seeking to announce important events to their members. 

## Usage
#### For **default users** (team members or those looking for new clubs):
* View all the clubs in the home menu
* Click on the big green button to *also* view a list of all the clubs (but in a pdf format! ..Isn't that so cool?)
* (Inside the Club Page): View each club's description and events.

#### For **administrators** (executives managing the club's page):
* Edit the overview displayed on the Home Page of the club.
* (Inside the Club Page): Edit the title and description.
* (Inside the Club Page): Add events in the integrated calendar (inside the Club Page).

*Must use an admin key to access these features (given by the manager).

#### For **the manager** (the one managing the whole website):
* Add clubs (after recieving official permission) with the top right button in the top right.
* Delete clubs (with great power comes great responsibility)
* View the list of all the admin keys.

*Must use a manager key to access these features.
